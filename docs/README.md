The purpose of Polysance is to facilitate vocational training and education in the area of electronic computing, including programming and integrated circuit design, using the methods and approach to problem definition, analysis and solution demonstrated by Charles H. Moore. These methods include the programming methodology named Forth, and the silicon design tools and computers produced by Mr. Moore and his colleagues between the 1980s and the present time. The approach is heavily cross-disciplinary and is driven by first principles.
